# LIBRARY-SerialPortAccess
Simple JNI capable serial port access lib

Inteded to be used for different embedded projects.
Currently supported architectures/operating systems:
- AMD 64 / Windows
- AMD 64 / Linux
- ARM 64 / Linux
- ARM 32 / Linux

Currently it does only provide simple serial port communication, but more features are implemented if required by my projects.
Planed are auto-detection of specific devices, list of available ports and some other utility stuff.
