To compile all binaries, toolchains for each platform are required:
- Windows amd64
- Linux amd64
- Linux arm64
- Linux arm32

Individual platforms can be out-commented in the build.meta files.
Alternatively only specific platforms can be build usind the platform specific Tasks (example: buildWinAMD64)
